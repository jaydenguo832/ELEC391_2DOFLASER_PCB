## The PCB RCGs:
**Requirements:**
1. The circuit must be capable of DC motor bi-directional and speed control to reflect the laser with the mirrors in any orientation and speed.
2. The PCB must support two DC motors with encoders operating at 12V.
3. No temporary mounting methods for the PCB to mitigate board freeplay, component damages, and provide a secure platform to function.

**Constraints:**
1. The PCB must not exceed a 13cm x 13cm footprint to best fit within the casing design.
2. The system must not exceed a maximum of 12V VS and 2A from the power supply to protect components from excessive voltage and current damage. 
3. Component choices and PCB manufacturing costs must be within the $800 budget.

**Goals:**
1. The PCB footprint should be as small as possible to reduce manufacturing costs.
2. Have a reliable 12V power source that can also be portable to be used in any location.
3. The system should be modular, and simple to interface such as plug-and-play connections, and provide test points for debugging.

## Key Features
1. Modular design
2. Integrated motor driver (L298N)
3. Dual Power Supply Solution for Power Jack and Battery
4. 5V and 12V Split Power Planes
5. Via Test Points
